How to install ssl certificate in ubuntu 18.04


first of all need to create .csr file from hosting server using blow command

#sudo mkdir /opt/ssl

#cd /opt/ssl

#sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout Project_name.key -out project_name.csr

this commnad will generate .csr file in ssl directory

copy the content from .csr and paste it in ssl provider .csr section

it will generate ssl certificate, you have to donload it and upload on ssl directory in our server

we need three file to impliment ssl

1 .crt
2 .key
3 chain/bundal.crt

.key file will generate with .csr and remaining file wwill get in ssl certificate

<VirtualHost *:443>

SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /opt/ssl/becard.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /opt/ssl/becard.key
SSLCertificateChainFile /opt/ssl/becardbundal.crt
</VirtualHost>
